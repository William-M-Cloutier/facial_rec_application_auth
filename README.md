This program will prevent unauthorized users from opening certain applications using facial recognition.

To start, add the application file path to the main.py file. Then add a picture of your face and put the file path in the face.py file.

Then, run the script. If an authorized user is detected, the application will open. Otherwise the application remains closed.

This is just the bare bones and more functionality can be added, such as continuous usage, multiple secret applications, etc.
